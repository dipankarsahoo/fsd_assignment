In this essay, I argue that the IMF can contribute more effectively to the global economy as a
platform for international dialogue if some improvements are achieved. I first point out
several changes in the economic environment brought by globalization. Next, I adduce a
recent example of an international monetary problem in which the IMF could have played an
important role, and then propose some points of improvement to ensure its vigorous
contribution.
Globalization brings about strong connections between economies, in which three “D”s -
dependence, diversity and dispute - prevail. In a globalized world, economies are
interdependent, and communities diversified. Dependence and diversity often entail the other
“D”, dispute. As it became apparent in the wake of the current financial crisis, there are
countless numbers of economic disputes around the world; disputes about currency regime,
cross-border capital flow, bank regulation, or current-account imbalances. The new
generation has to work together to settle these disputes, and I believe a key to solution is the
fourth “D”, dialogue. International dialogues shall improve mutual understandings among
countries, which is a basis for financial stability.
